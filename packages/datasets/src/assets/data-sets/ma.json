      "text": "so lets see how you can create this animation with framer motion. cool basic implementation pe aa jaate hain. ye jo line dikh rahi hai this is an svg which can be seen down below it is called line svg. this is the svg. first things first. to pehle to on mouse move would be handle mouse move. handle mouse move pe kya karna hai? mere ko isko left and right ghumaana hai. to uske liye pehle mere ko mouse x lena padega. cost mouse x equal to use motion value initially zero pe set ho jayega. aur container f since maine isko de rakha hai to main move direction pe bata sakta hun ki ye kaise kaam karega aur ye main chhap leta hun yahan se. basically main yahan kya karna chah raha hun. agar container hai to rectangle nikaal raha hun bounding client rect aur usse main x calculate kar raha hun client width minus rectangle left karke aur aadha karke basically. so once i move this thing mouse x dot set thodi usme springiness kyunki aapne dekha tha springi behavior chahiye. to uske liye kya karenge? spring x kar lenge. spring x ka kya hoga? basically ek spring you spring hook video mein baat kari hai aur mouse x ko isko agar parameter pass kar de with these default values just stiffness damping vagairah vagairah vagairah to usse will get the spring x value that you can basically pass inu the style tag left would be used transform spring x aur ye zero se one jab hoegi to mere ko 0% se 100% chahiye. now agar main aapko dikhau to yah hamara move kar raha hai. yah ho gaya aadha part. remaining part would be to animate clip aath property. to usko dekh lete hain kaise karte hain. to ham baat kar rahe the clip progress ki. ab hamen chahiye zero se clip progress kaha jata hai? to hamare paas mein spring x already hai jo ki zero se one pe jaata hai. to zero se one agar wo gaya to mujhe chahiye clip progress zero se 100. since we have this clip progress. ab ham bol denge clip path template would be we use motion template. and it will take two back ticks. motion template back tick leti hai. aur hamen chahiye hota hai vaise hi ideally clip path hota hai insert 0 but instead of this we need something else. so what we need here is instead of this we need a use transform. aur isame hamen basically pass kar dena hai clip progress and clip progress can also take a call back which will be a v here. and we actually want to return here is hamen minus karke values deni hai. 100 minus v and outside of it would be percentage. cool. ab ye jo clip path template hamare paas mein aayi, yah ham basically is motional dib pe de denge. this will be clip path would be clip path tlet. and now you see once i adjust this to yah move kar raha hai. i will see in the next one. thank you so much. if you want me to drop more such tutorials let me know pretty easy. iske playground ka link. i will share with you in the description. do check it."

      "text": "market jobs. I'm tired of listening the news around AI taking over jobs. One thing that you can do right now to make it foolproof that AI won't be able to take a job is to constantly upskill. The value ad that you get when you constantly upskill is immense asymmetric returns. Instead of sitting down and figuring out if AI, you should rather focus on how AI can help you level up as an engineer. Now, if you're starting out, if you're a beginner and using a lot of AI help, I recommend you do not do it. Build solid foundations, you'll have enough capacity, enough knowledge to actually use AI to your advantage. to get replaced by AI full try to do it from scratch minimal help creative mind explore probably you can use AI a lot for example if you write a JSON object formatting you can pretty much use AI to just format it in a second rather than you spending half an hour on it but if you want to build a strong foundation turn off autopilot turn off cursor chart window and then code struggle a it now so that you are actually able to provide value and problem solving skills actually develop otherwise you're just hitting tab and you know doing things one good example of doing it is actually disabling AI at all if you are going to practice for example if you want to practice motion components you can go to uih2.com/playground and you'll see a playground here which is nothing but a code editor and a window for you to preview for example it'll be something like this you'll have to code this up you won't have any AI help over here If you can do it, then it makes sense for you to use AI to help you optimize it a bit better later on then it makes sense for you to use AI but practice in a no AI environment. If you are a beginner and if you want to build your foundation strong you know use all the AI that you want and that is the point then AI will actually help you level up as an engineer and then productivity enhances disable co-pilot and code yourself.

      "text": " [Music] Learn how to create this animation in 60 seconds with framework motion which is now motion.dev tailwind CSS and react. So let's get started. So here we have this empty container to start with. What I'll do is I'll quickly create the styling for this. First of all, we need a button. What I'll do is button call it share feedback. I'll give it some classes. PX4 PY2 rounded MD VG gray 100 border border gray 200 text gray 600 let's see how our button looks looks decent I'll convert it to a motion button and give it a layout ID of feedback now I only want to show this button if the open flag is not there that means if the button or the text area which is not opened yet I want to have this in place so if it is opened I want to have a div let's say again I want So have it a BG gray 100 border border gray 200 text gray 600 rounded MD and I want it to be at 60 with 40. Let's assume inside I to have a text area rows would be five. What I want to have here is I don't want it to resize. So I will be having a resize none class focus border none and outline none. So it is not having any borders. Yeah, let's see how it works now. Once I click on it, nothing happens because I haven't hooked the on click on it. On click would be set open to true and on mouse or on enter press. So I'll check for on key press hook. I want to have an E event. And I want to basically check if the event is an enter key and I want to set it to false. Let's see how it works. On key down. Cool. Let's see. Text area is here. It is looking pretty bad. I'll style it a bit better. I'll have a placeholder of share your feedback and three dots. Let's see how it looks. Goes out of the window. Adjust the styling a bit. Width make 60. Cool. Cool. Now we have the button. Click on it. No animation. Now if I convert it to motion div and give the layout ID to be feedback. Now once I click on it, it expands. Once I enter something, it goes back. Click expand. All of it is done with the help of layout ID. Pretty straightforward to use in frame motion. And this was the basic feedback form component with motion with just one layout ID. Hope you like this one."

      "text": "So since GBT ka updated model aaya hai for usme aap images bhi bana sakte ho. So you cannot only create gibli arts jo ki aajkal sabhi kar rahe hain. What you can do is you can put it to a creative use into your business. For example what I am trying to hear now I am trying to create thumbnails for my YouTube videos. This is one such thumbnail that you can come up with. This is another. There are many variants of and I will tell you the process how you can create thumbnails on your own. But these are like the very start. Abhi maine apna image model bhi train nahi kiya hai is pe. Once I do it. Yeh image properly puri replace ho jayegi and you know it will be all authentic. Mere ko karne ki bhi jarurat nahi hai. Ek bari maine model train kar diya. Wo bhi sikhaunga next two to videos mein. But I will tell you how you can generate prp and you know generate the entire thumbnail for it. What you have to is prp copy paste karna hai aur niche deep research dikh raha hoga. I not sure isme dikh raha hai nahi dikh raha. But deep research hai wo kar do. Click on it and it will give you an outline of this. What it does is this prp will exactly give you another prp jisse aap thumbnails generate karoge. This is what it gives me at the end. Ye pura mere ko title de deta hai, topic de deta hai, diz directions de deta hai aur deliverable de deta hai. This is one prt that you can copy. Go to another chat. Copy paste this prp aur apni image dal de idhar. Niche aap title de sakte ho. Title maine yaha diya tha. Front end fails likh ke aa raha tha. I corrected it. It should say this and this and this. Okay? Jo bhi mere ko changes karna hai main udhar karta. And I got these thumbnails. I want to show you. We can do a lot many other things. Uske liye main kya karunga yaar? Mere paas kya hai? Mere paas this this batman ki gaadi hai. Main iski photo lunga aur iska product photo shoot karne ki try karta hun. I will open a new chat GBT prp. Ab yaha pe main photo dal deta hun. To ye batman ki car ki photo hai. Mere paas ek car padi hai. To what I want to is I want to create a product photo shoot. Create a product photoshoot of this toy car. Make it look larger than life. Keep it somewhere where it looks expensive. Luxurious. And ting keep in mind this is for a product photo shoot cool lets see how it works out 11 minutes later so this is the image that it has created dekh rahe ho you eliminate a photographer you eliminate an editor matlab if not the entire people you can cut down on the resources so that you can actually retreat faster for example ab mere ko iski jagah background ki jagah kuch aur background chahiye I can quickly go back and say ki yaar iska background actually mere ko yeh nahi chahiye. Change the background to something dark like an underground alleyway some rainfall make sure it looks luxurious make the car look hyper realistic. Lets see ab yeh kya karta hai. So you can create something like this looks super cool man. So ya you can create things like product photoshoot thumbnails Instagram covers food pictures for example swiggy zomato vagaira website pe jo dalte hain that a i models you can create matlab bahut saari endless opportunities so make sure you explore it in that way hope this video was helpful I will see in the next one."

      "text": "Another underrated property in Tailwind is or in CSS in general is masking. Like what is linear gradient and how you can mask images with a linear gradient. Underrated property but you can create crazy looking designs with masking. So for example I have this tailwind playa console or you can say a playground open play.tailwind css.com. So at the right side you'll have the preview left code and you can play with tailwind here. What I essentially want to do is card And how can I bring some fading effect into it? I can use things like mask. I'll just go here, zoom it a bit so that you can see. And this is the exact div that I have to play with. So instead of this, I'll just add something more here. And I'll write custom tailwind here, which will be man. If you want to write CSS inside of tailwind CSS like you see here, you have to use square braces. So I'll use mask image linear gradient to top transparent white. So now you see images but for this readym made example. Similarly you can have it the right also using the similar syntax but since we are using tailwind CSS v4 there's a very helpful utility for it called mask B and it'll do the exact same thing for you. Similar utility that we have here is mask B and I'll say mask B from 50%. You also see the syntax highlighting going on here which is super. So once you see if you hover over to the intelligence that we have here like super cool super helpful for Example class would be rounded to Excel. You can hit do stuff like that% super cool. I hope you find this helpful and I'll see you in the next"
